A collection of google colab notebooks used to develop unique convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks

## CIFAR10_Lotus_Model_CNN.ipynb
Contains a CNN developed to maximise accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image set. The specification for this model was created by a deep learning research to ensure our work was original. The model achieved 95.17% accuracy which would place it at rank 125 in the papers with code https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-cifar-10 and achieve parity with state-of-the-art in 2019-2020.
